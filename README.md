# 1. The Adventure of Joe and Marie (Inspired by Bread and Fred)
“The Adventure of Joe and Marie” is a fun and challenging platformer game where two characters, Joe and Marie, work together to explore tricky levels. Inspired by Bread and Fred, players are tied together and must jump, swing, and climb as a team. You can play with a friend or control both characters on your own. The game is filled with funny moments, cute art, and puzzles that need teamwork to solve. It’s great for players who enjoy co-op games and fun adventures.
