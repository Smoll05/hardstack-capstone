# Capstone Project General Idea
## Games:

 ### 1. Drinking Mama (Inspired by Cooking Mama)

"Drinking Mama" is an idea for a casual game where players would take on the role of a bartender. Inspired by Cooking Mama, the concept involves mixing, shaking, and serving a variety of drinks in a fast-paced, fun environment. The game would allow players to craft unique cocktails, create refreshing mocktails, and serve drinks with precision and speed. It would be perfect for casual players and drink enthusiasts alike, encouraging creativity and quick thinking.

 ### 2. Farm Life (Inspired by Stardew Valley)

"Farm Life" is an idea for a farming simulator inspired by Stardew Valley. In this concept, players would inherit a run-down farm and work to restore it to its former glory. They would grow crops, raise animals, and build a vibrant farm community. The game would feature seasonal changes (hopefully), different crops to grow, and various animals to care for, offering an immersive and relaxing experience. Players could also interact with the local town, fish, and complete tasks to thrive in their farming life.

###  3. Classic Chess
This idea revolves around creating a digital version of the timeless strategy game Chess. The concept would allow players to enjoy Chess on various platforms, either by challenging friends, or playing against AI. The game would stay true to the classic rules and strategies of Chess, providing an opportunity for players of all skill levels to improve their strategic thinking and enjoy the game.

## Application:
###  1. ADH Helper Chatbot
The ADH Helper Chatbot is an idea for a chatbot designed to assist individuals with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). This concept would help users manage their daily tasks, set reminders, and stay productive by offering personalized support. The chatbot would provide helpful suggestions for staying focused, breaking tasks into manageable steps, and maintaining motivation throughout the day, making life easier for those managing ADHD.
